SENTIMENT_ANALYSIS

This project is a simple Machine Learning classifier that predicts the sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral) of text data using TF-IDF Vectorization and Logistic Regression.


=> Project Overview
Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn

Algorithm: TF-IDF + Logistic Regression

Dataset: 500+ custom text samples labeled as Positive, Negative, or Neutral

Accuracy: ~88% on test data


=> How It Works

Loads text data from sentiment.csv

Cleans and vectorizes the text using TF-IDF

Splits data into training and testing sets

Trains a Logistic Regression classifier

Predicts sentiment for new text input


=> Files

sentiment.csv — labeled dataset (500+ lines)

sentiment.py — Python script for training & testing
